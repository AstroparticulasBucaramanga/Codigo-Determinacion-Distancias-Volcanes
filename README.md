# Code for the Determination of Distances in Volcanoes
This code calculates the distances traversing particles through the topography of a mountain. It is made in MatLab and makes use of topography and elevation data points of the earth and determines distances from a fixed point entering the mountain until it leaves the topography again for an angular window (zenith, azimuth).
